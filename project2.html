							<p>This project was my Bachelor thesis at SGH Warsaw School of Economics.
								I defended my thesis and graduated from SGH with the grade 4.5 (Polish grading system max. 5.0). Project can confirm that I am able to do data analysis and
								use different models not only in IT related problems, but also in finance and economics.

						<h2>Abstract</h2>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								In a world of financial markets characterised by constant change over time, financial institutions and investors are very often exposed to risk.
								Elimination of risk is impossible, but there are ways to mitigate risk. Various risk management systems help to
								ensure that the right techniques are used to measure risk. The most important measures include Value at Risk and Expected Loss,
								which can be determined using a variety of methods. The correctness of these methods is assessed using various tests, which in
								the literature are called back-testing. </p>
							<p>
								The paper entitled "Comparative analysis of the backtesting of VaR and ES risk estimation methods for the Polish stock exchange indices WIG20,
								mWIG40 and sWIG80" presents the subject of financial risk modelling and analyses of the results of empirical research on three stock exchange indices.
								The research consisted in backtesting of various methods of estimating risk measures VaR and ES. Among these methods was a simple
								non-parametric model, i.e. a historical simulation, but also a computationally complex GARCH model. The paper analyses the results not only
								for individual stock indices, but also performs a comparative analysis.

						<h4>Main goals and research questions</h4>
						This work aims to discuss the subject of financial risk modelling and back testing of VaR and
						conditional ES value. The paper presents the results of empirical research on time series of three stock exchange indices
						from the Warsaw Stock Exchange, namely WIG20, mWIG40 and sWIG80. Using five methods of estimating risk measures,
						including two that take into account the variability of the random component over time, the following questions were answered:
						<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
							<li>Which of the proposed methods provides the best estimate of risk measures for selected stock indices?</li>
							<li>Does the best method of estimating VaR and ES depend on the choice of the stock exchange index?</li>
							<li>Are there similarities within the same stock exchange index as regards the usefulness of VaR and ES conditional VaR estimation methods?</li>
							<li>Are the methods taking into account the variability of the variance of the random component
								over time better for estimating Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall values for selected stock indices?</li>
							<li>How could the results have been influenced by the historical data in the time series of stock indices from the recent financial crisis?</li>
					</ul>

						</p>
						<p>
							The first chapter deals with the topic of financial risk modelling starting from the very definition of risk and the already mentioned measures.
							Then the methods of estimating these measures and estimating financial time series are presented.The first chapter concludes with an introduction
							to VaR and ES back-testing with an explanation of examples of tests such as the Christoffersen cover independence test.
							The second chapter presents selected data and methodologies used in empirical studies, the results of which, together with brief comments, are included in chapter three.
							The next chapter is a comparative analysis of research
							results for the three stock exchange indices and conclusions, including answers to the questions asked in the introduction.
