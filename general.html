									<h1> My story </h1>
									<p> From a boy in a small village <br />
										to a man with great ambitions and an international soul<br /> </p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/mesea_resize.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>
									I grew up in a small village called Grzymaly.  In the nearby town Lomza, I attended high school, which I graduated with honors.
									The average score of all my maturity exams is 86,71%. I passed maturity exam in advanced mathematics with 100%  result which was top 4% in Poland.
									Getting into one of the best universities in Poland with these results was not a problem for me.
                                </p>
								<p>
									As a matter of fact, my history as a student has begun at the Warsaw University of Technology, but after two years I realized that
									I want to use my technical skills in something different than only programming applications.
									I came into conclusion that I want to combine my computer science and mathematical skills into a statistical, econometric and data analysis.
									I figured out that Data Science which include different things like Machine Learning and Data Analysis is a great area for my future career.
									This conclusion was the most important reason why I also started to do Bachelor of Science in Quantitative Methods in Economics and Information
									Systems at the SGH Warsaw School of Economics. In aim to advance my knowledge about quantitative methods
									I applied for Master program at University of Bonn and chose Econometrics & Statistics specialization.
								</p>

								<p>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/sgh_dyplom.png" alt="" /></span>While doing my Bachelor thesis at Warsaw School of Economics I also tried to combine quantitative methods with my technical skills.
									The topic of the thesis, which was entitled “Comparative analysis of backtesting of VaR and ES risk estimation methods for the mWIG40,
									sWIG80 and WIG20 polish stock indices”, was I think relatively ambitious. The research question was which model, among historical simulation,
									EWMA, GARCH, is best to measure risk of investment on the Polish stock market. To address this question, I conducted a set of backtests for
									conditional and unconditional coverage.
								</p>
								<p>
									My second and previous Bachelor thesis at Warsaw University of Technology I also used topics not only related to Computer Science.
									In the work titled "Simulations and generations of traffic organization schemes in the city scale" algorithms and models that could be
									useful in two modules of modern traffic management systems were presented. The first module would be responsible for the prediction of
									traffic intensity, and the second for simulating traffic in the city. For research in the diploma thesis most algorithms
									have been implemented using the R programming language and the MATLAB program.
								</p>
								<p>
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/UniBonn_story.jpg" alt="" /></span>After a while, I found out that Polish universities were not enough for me.
									That's why I applied to study at the University of Bonn. I am currently in the last semester of my studies,
									which in various world rankings are in a very high position. My last semester, due to the crisis of the new
									disease COVID-19, will be completely remote. In the course of my studies, I have carried out many projects on
									data science in Python that can also be found on this website.
								</p>
								<p>
									It is commonly known that solid education is very important for being an expert and it is the reason why
									I learn not only during my studies and lectures, but also, I use different possibilities which are available in the internet.
									I have already done for example course on coursera “Machine Learning” provided by Stanford University.
									It provides different topics for instance: Logistic Regression, K-NN, SVM, Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classification,
									Random Forest Classification, K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, Natural Language Processing.
									I have finished also Data Science specialization provided by IBM. I love Data Science and I am willing to learn continuously,
									so I still do bunch of courses on coursera and I read books related to Machine Learning.
								</p>
								<p>
									I know that looking for Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer position during crisis related to the new disease COVID-19 will be
									challenging for me, but I am going to keep trying. In my everyday life I always try to raise the bar and I always do my best to tackle challenges.
									I am very motivated person and I have to point out once again that I am passionate about Data Science.
									You can be sure that I would be a great asset for your company.
