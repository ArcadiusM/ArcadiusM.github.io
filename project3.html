                                <h4>Abstract</h4>
                                <blockquote>
                                    <p>
                                        In the present world, when car vehicles are a publicly available good, it can
                                        be stated that almost every person has met with traffic jams as a pedestrian
                                        or a driver. The expanded urban agglomerations do not allow for the
                                        expansion of the road network, but modern traffic management systems
                                        come to the city to better organize traffic flows. In the work titled
                                        "Simulations and generations of traffic organization schemes in the city
                                        scale" algorithms and models that could be useful in two modules of such
                                        a system were presented. The first module would be responsible for the
                                        prediction of traffic intensity, and the second for simulating traffic in the
                                        city. For the prediction of data, a mathematical and statistical
                                        autoregressive integrated moving average, otherwise called the ARIMA
                                        model, was proposed, while cellular automaton were used to model the
                                        traffic flows. Three cellular automata were presented as an extension of the
                                        Nagel-Schreckenberg model, which is used in traffic engineering to simulate
                                        motorway traffic. For research in the diploma thesis most algorithms have
                                        been implemented using the R programming language and the MATLAB
                                        program. While testing the correctness of forecasting the ARIMA model,
                                        time series were used which constitute historical data of traffic intensity at
                                        the intersections of the road No. 91 with streets in three cities in the
                                        Pomeranian Voivodship. These data were taken from publicly available
                                        information published by the General Directorate of National Roads and
                                        Motorways. In this work you can not only familiarize yourself with the
                                        proposed algorithms, but also with the basic concepts of traffic engineering,
                                        the basics of time series analysis and cellular automata.

                                    In this work it was undertaken to propose algorithms that could be used in two modules of the urban traffic management system.
                                    The first one would be responsible for generating both current and future traffic volumes, while the second would be used to
                                    simulate vehicle traffic. These two modules would form an integral part of the overall system.

								<h4>Project includes three parts:</h4>
                                <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                                    <li><b>General introduction</b> - introduces the general subject of traffic engineering.
                                        The basic concepts in road traffic are discussed, such as traffic volume, capacity and speed.
                                        Next, the general subject of traffic modelling and briefly the Integrated Traffic Management System in Warsaw is presented.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Traffic volume predictions</b> - second part is fully devoted to traffic prediction.
                                        The method proposed for data prediction is a mathematical-statistical model for the analysis of historical data in a time series.
                                        The first part of this chapter introduces the subject of time series and the proposed model for series representation and forecasting,
                                        and the second part shows the authentic research carried out for the work for three intersections in the Pomeranian Voivodeship.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Cellular automata part</b> - third part presents the introduction to cellular automats and their subsequent use in traffic modelling.
                                        One of the most important automats in traffic simulation is given and an extended model is proposed, which already reflects the basic features of traffic in an urban agglomeration.
